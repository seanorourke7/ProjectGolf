# Seans Golf Adventures

Seans Golf Adventures is a Blog about golf courses around Ireland. The idea is to post about your visit to a course and leave feedback. The models ask for specific information like the players handicap, tees played off and their score at the end of the round. The user as well as admin can post to it but only Admin can approve posts to be published. It encourages interaction through inviting the user to comment and like other peoples posts and to even submit a post themselves. 

The live link can be found here: [Live Site - Seans Golf Adventures](https://projectgolf-537a6c2d3f19.herokuapp.com/)
